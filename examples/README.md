Pick the scenario, then jump to the jq you need.

- **Basic Workflow:** `basic-workflow.md` — single feature from init → done; includes quick validation jq (counts, next step).
- **Complex Multi-Feature:** `complex-project.md` — parallel work, blocked tracks, superseded approach; has cross-feature jq (blocked, completion %, superseded vs new).
- **AI Agent Usage:** `ai-agent-usage.md` — multi-session handoffs; now with a warm-up jq trio for fast context reload.
- **jq Recipes Library:** `jq-recipes.md` — grab-and-go one-liners for common questions (blocked, missing next, files by feature, completion snapshot, superseded).
